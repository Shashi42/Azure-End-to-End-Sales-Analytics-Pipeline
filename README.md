# Azure End to End Data Engineering Pipeline

This project builds an End-to-End Azure Data Engineering Solution. A Pipeline performing Data Ingestion, ETL and Analytics all-in-one solution using Microsoft Azure Services and Power BI.

## Goal of the Project

The goal is to create an Azure solution which can take an On-premise Database such as the Microsoft SQL Server Management System (SSMS) and move it to the Cloud. It does so by building an ETL pipeline using Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks and Azure Synapse Analytics.

The project is also connected to a reporting dashboard using Microsoft Power BI.
